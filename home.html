            These green human figures push the limits of traditional collectibles. While other collectibles have more intricate designs, these figures are more on the simple side. Their faces all display a simple emotionless face and are pasted onto each figurine. The vibrant green color creates a sense of uniqueness compared to other figures. The figurines are also not to mention glow in the dark

The characters' jelly-like look gives them a dynamic, almost liquid appearance that is both visually appealing and conceptually refreshing.
