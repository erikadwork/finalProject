            These green human figures push the limits of traditional collectibles. While other collectibles have more intricate designs, these figures are more on the simple side. Their faces all display a simple emotionless face and are pasted onto each figurine. The vibrant green color creates a sense of uniqueness compared to other figures. The figurines are also not to mention glow in the dark. Placing under a light will easily charge the figurines and they will glow bright as ever in the dark.. Their simplicity allows the viewers to take appreciation in the minimalistic designs and pay more attention to their actions and poses rather than extreme detail. The overall aesthetic successfully balances modern minimalism with a playful, almost surreal quality, making them popular among those who value originality and simplicity.
