                    **Meet our Researcher: Alex**
                    Alex is our resident coffee fiend, powering through mystery-box research 
                    one espresso shot at a time. When he’s off the clock, you’ll find him 
                    conquering video game worlds or meticulously assembling Gundams, LEGO sets,
                    and anything else with tiny pieces. And don’t let a lull in the day fool 
                    you—Alex never misses a chance to unleash a perfectly timed prank on the team.
